# rock-paper-scissors
<p>Rock Paper Scissors is a classic game that has been used for generations to pass time, settle bets, and make decisions.</p>
<p>Just in case you don't already know the rules, here they are: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Rock beats scissors</li>
	<li>Scissors beats paper</li>
	<li>Paper beats rock</li>
</ul>
<p>To start, the two players say out loud, "Rock, Paper, Scissors....shoot!". On shoot (yes, I'm an 'on shoot' kind of guy), both players show their option by making the corresponding symbol with their hand. The game is typically played as best-of-three or best-of-five.</p>
